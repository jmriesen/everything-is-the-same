# Purpose
After reading [You're Not Qualified To Have An Opinion On TDD](https://blog.boot.dev/clean-code/youre-not-qualified-for-tech-opinions/)
I realized that I needed to do a better job of testing the ideas I am exposed to.

I enjoy listening to conference talks and speculating about new ideas and practices, most of witch sound great.
But for most of these ideas I lacked the experience to say if they will actually be useful in practice.

In collage I studied Math, and that experiences taught me that one of the best ways of exploring an idea, is to write your thoughts down and discuss them with others.

I intend for this project to be a space where I can wrestle with ideas, and figure out what concept's stand up to scrutiny.

# Everything is the same
"Everything is the same" is a phrase my former martial arts instructor liked to say. 
Regardless of whether we were using the sward bo staff or fighting hand to hand, the core concepts and stances remained the same.
However beyond that after discussing my hobby, ballroom dance, with him we found a number of connections between the two disciplines.
After all the core of both martial arts and ballroom is moving your body with control and stability.

I have found that the core of problems tends not to be unique.
There are throughlines from martial arts to ballroom to self help books to books on code refactoring.

At the end the day most domain specific problems are just a manifestation of a more general challenge. Ie. "Everything is the same"
