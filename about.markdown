# Website motivation
I have found that to truly explore and a concept one has to use it.
It is easy to appreciate a coral performance, but to truly understand the nuances one has to learn to sign.
With in the realm of ideas and philosophy one of the most efficient ways to "use" and idea is to write about it and discuss it with others.

This website is intended to provide me the opportunity to write about topics and discuss it with my reviewers.
If anyone else outside that group of people find this site and find my musing useful I would love to hear about it, but know that you are not my target audience.

# Why "Everything is the same"
Everything is the same was a phrase my martial arts instructor liked to say. 
Regardless of wether we were using the sward bo-staff or fighting hand to hand, the core concepts and stances remained the same.
However beyond that after discussing my hobby, ballroom dance, with him we found a number of connections between the two disciplines.
After all the core of both martial arts and ballroom is moving your body with control and stability.

I have found that the core of problems tends not to be unique.
There are throughlines from martial arts to ballroom to self help books to books on code refactoring.

At the end the day most domain specific problems are just a manifestation of a more general challenge. Ie. "Everything is the same"

# Impetus for this project
After reading [You're Not Qualified To Have An Opinion On TDD ](https://blog.boot.dev/clean-code/youre-not-qualified-for-tech-opinions/) I realized I needed to do a better job of testing the ideas I was exposed to.

I enjoy listening to conference talks and had therefore been exposed many ideas, most of witch sound great.
But I lacked the experience to say if any of them would actually be useful.
