***"In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is.":Yogi Berra***

# Purpose
After reading [You're Not Qualified To Have An Opinion On TDD](https://blog.boot.dev/clean-code/youre-not-qualified-for-tech-opinions/)
I realized that I needed to do a better job of testing the ideas I am exposed to.

I enjoy listening to conference talks and speculating about new ideas and practices, most of which sound great.
But for most of these ideas I lacked the experience to say if they will actually be useful in practice.

In college I studied math, and that experiences taught me that one of the best ways to explore an idea is to write your thoughts down and discuss them with others.

I intend for this project to be a space where I can wrestle with ideas, and figure out what concept's stand up to scrutiny.

# Everything is the same
My former martial arts instructor repeatedly emphasized that at is core "Everything is the same." 
Regardless of whether we were using the sward, bo staff or fighting hand to hand, the core concepts and stances remained the same.
However this concept extends beyond just martial arts.

Core concepts and parallels can be pulled from domains that initially seem vary desperate.
I have found connection between:
- A [self help books](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36072.The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=iq7dwHp4UL&rank=1)
- A books on [Working Effectively with legacy Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44919.Working_Effectively_with_Legacy_Code)
- Videos on how to organization your home (TODO get the channel name from mother)
- And a [treatise on martial arts techniques](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50644468-through-dragonfly-eyes).

As humans we like to categorize things, to break them down into neat little domains. 
We divide things into:
- School subjects
    - The sciences
    - Mathematics
    - The arts
- Type of programming
    - Frontend
    - Backend
    - Embodied
    - Performance
- Types of media
    - Informational
    - Entertainment
    - Fiction
    - Non-fiction

But at the end of the day, these things just exist in the universe, independent of human categorization.
Categorizations are just a useful tool to help us comprehend, describe, discuss the world. 
They are not intrinsic to the universe. T0o often people (including me) forget that, and take the dominant categorization as the only one.
